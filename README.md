# Rust-Learning
This is first course i learn Rust from VBI Blockchain Academy.

# Talking about Rust
Although this is a relatively new language, Rust is a language that builds on many other programming languages ​​that I have learned. Its structure is quite similar to C++, and execution speed is as fast as C++; has many functions quite similar to Javastript. At first I thought Rust was a really messy language because I've learned C++ and compared to C++, it's really messy and has a lot of silly functions. But then I realized it's all because Rust works so well that it's hard to learn. In addition, Rust has many more functions such as Borrowing or Ownership, which makes managing variables in this language very confusing, although this is a mechanism that has never been in programming languages ​​since ancient times. In short, Rust is hard to learn and I just want to say that my code is the result of what I learned.
